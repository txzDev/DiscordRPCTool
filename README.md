# How to set up

### 1. Get your client ID 

Depending on the version, there should be a working link next to the ClientID box, but if not continue reading.
Head over to https://discord.com/developers/applications and click "New Application". 
Give it a name and click "Create". Go to the App and click OAuth2 on the left side and you should find the Client ID.

### 2. Add it to the tool

Open the tool and head over to the settings tab (Click the settings button) and paste in your ID into the "ClientID" box.
Fill in the rest of your desired text.

For the image, Go back to https://discord.com/developers/applications and click on your App. On the left side, click "Rich Presence -> Art Assets" and add your desired image.

## NOTE: The image name is your Image key. For example if your picture's name is logox25 then you have to put exactly that into the tool, so make the image name something easy.
